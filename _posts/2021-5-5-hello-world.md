Designing this template was a pretty fun and interesting challenge — we wanted to come up with something that was really beautiful and inspiring, but that was also unopinionated enough to feel like a good fit for almost anyone. We landed on a pretty minimalist design that gets it’s personality from little touches like rotated images, hints of color for links, and some subtle depth from shadows and layering in places like the top navigation.
