Ah, it feels like a lifetime since I last delved into the world of Jekyll! You know, that feeling when you reunite with an old friend after ages? That's how I feel about Jekyll.

There's just something about Jekyll that speaks to me. It's like the reliable buddy who's always there when you need them. No frills, no fussâ€”just good ol' simplicity. And let's face it, sometimes you just don't need all the bells and whistles of a fancy database for your static website.

I first stumbled upon Jekyll back in 2020, and boy, did it change the game for me. But life got hectic, as it tends to do, and before I knew it, it was 2022â€”the last time I danced in the realms of Jekyll. Can you believe it? Time flies when you're knee-deep in projects and juggling government gigs.

But hey, that's life for you. You roll with the punches and make the most of what comes your way. Recently, I found myself tinkering with Jekyll again. Updating URLs here, adding a sprinkle of `{ { base.url }}` thereâ€”just giving my old pal a little makeover.

Now, as I sit here pondering over the theme I've chosen, I can't help but wonder: Is it still as relatable as it once was? Ah, but that's a question for the ages, isn't it? Only timeâ€”and perhaps a discerning eyeâ€”will tell.

Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read through my Jekyll journey. And hey, remember: You're doing great today! Keep on rocking, my friend. ðŸ˜‰
